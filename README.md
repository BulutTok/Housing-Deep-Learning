# House Price Prediction Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses deep learning to predict house prices based on a variety of housing features. The model is developed using TensorFlow and Keras in Python, and the dataset is processed using a combination of numerical and categorical preprocessing steps.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need:
- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Google Colab (optional for running .ipynb notebooks directly)

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
Install the required libraries
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow
Data
The data is stored in Google Drive under My Drive/Colab Notebooks. Ensure you have the files train.csv, test.csv, and sample_submission.csv in this directory.

## Running the Notebook
If you are using Google Colab:

Open the notebook HousePrice_AssignmentDeepLearning.ipynb directly in Google Colab and connect to your drive using:
python
Copy code
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
Model Architecture
The model consists of:

## Input layer
Two hidden layers with 128 neurons each, using ReLU activation
One hidden layer with 64 neurons, using ReLU activation
Output layer with a single neuron, using linear activation for regression
The model uses the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function
Usage
Execute the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and predict house prices. The predictions are saved to a CSV file submission_dl.csv.
